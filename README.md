# RoboStroller

Welcome to the repository dedicated to the hobby project for baby stroller robotization. 

This repository contains materials that allows you to convert conventional baby stroller into hi-tech autonomous driving vehicle (at least driving straight till the first obstacle :innocent:).

#### Motivation
I want to change the world and become Steve Jobs in stroller market - this will fulfill my ego, wallet and ambitions :man_shrugging::man_facepalming:.

To be serious, there are couple of drivers to make this hobby project for me:
1. learn new things (product design, 3d printing...)
2. try out new technologies (programming for the controllers, mobile development, testing)
3. automate some of the routines (still the child)
4. share my findings/experience/results with the community

I consider this project as hobby, it may have some value to you, or it may not, anyway it is fun!
